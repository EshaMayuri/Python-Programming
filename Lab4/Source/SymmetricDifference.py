# Program to find symmetric diffference between two sets
# initialising sets
x = set(["Education","is","a", "most"])
y = set(["is","a", "most","powerful", "weapon"])
# symmetric difference
z= x^y
# printing the output
print("The first set is", x)
print("The second set is", x)
print("The symmetric difference between two sets(x^y) is",z)
