Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance
criterion using example data or past experience. We need learning in
cases where we cannot directly write a computer program to solve a given
problem, but need example data or experience. One case where learning
is necessary is when human expertise does not exist, or when humans
are unable to explain their expertise. Consider the recognition of spoken
speech—that is, converting the acoustic speech signal to an ASCII text;
we can do this task seemingly without any difficulty, but we are unable
to explain how we do it. Different people utter the same word differently
due to differences in age, gender, or accent. In machine learning, the approach
is to collect a large collection of sample utterances from different
people and learn to map these to words.
Another case is when the problem to be solved changes in time, or
depends on the particular environment. We would like to have generalpurpose
systems that can adapt to their circumstances, rather than explicitly
writing a different program for each special circumstance. Consider
routing packets over a computer network. The path maximizing
the quality of service from a source to destination changes continuously
as the network traffic changes. A learning routing program is able to
adapt to the best path by monitoring the network traffic. Another example
is an intelligent user interface that can adapt to the biometrics of
its user—namely, his or her accent, handwriting, working habits, and so
forth.
